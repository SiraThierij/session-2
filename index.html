    <h1>Everybody <small>– Backstreet Boys</small></h1>
    <h3>The group</h3>
    <p>The Backstreet Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band of all time, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Sade to have their first nine albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. The Backstreet Boys are one of the few boy bands to have continued success long after their peak. Their 2013 album In a World Like This debuted in the top five, two decades after the group was formed. The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013.<p>
